          <h1> Opthalianthus Lore </h1>
          <h2> Introduction to the world of Opthalianthus! </h2>
          <p1> Opthalianthus, named after the Collision of the 5, is a super-planet, a planet conjoined with 5 other planets, in the super-collision which happened in the year 3476, giving this planet the characteristics of 5 completely different planets combined into one, Therefore making it extremely unstable, still habitable, but very dangerous. This planet is one massive abomination; the planet is unstable at some sections of the collided worlds, these have come to be known as fissure points, the conjoined sections of the world. Over the years, methods were placed to ensure the stability of the planet, and after 37 years they succeeded. Massive gravity pillars were placed at even lengths across the fissure points, and once powered, pulled the pieces together and kind of welded them in place. Opthalianthus is a combination as stated before of 5 planets, Opthallies, Lithianthus, Zaloc, Nova and Eregeten. Each one of these planets has its own, different plane, and during the collision and over the years, these have all merged together, creating a diverse and unique environment. </p1> 

<h2> How the Collision of the 5 occurred! </h2>
<p1> How the planets came to collide at the same time is still unknown, however, the collision and how it took place, there are theories on how this disaster happened, some being that they were knocked out of their orbit, and by chance veered towards Seran, which caused this major catastrophe, another one is that they were sent this way by an alien force, who were trying to see how well we would cope with this amount of destruction, but then again these are just theories, but what really happened is that each one of these planets that collided, were meant to be together as this planet originally, as this planet was a fabrication of a greater alien power, and they fabricated 5 different planets. Eregeten for formed from the destruction of 35 moons, combined with space ice and debris, hence why this planet is so cold, Nova was formed in the core of a supernova, how they built it and them and the planet survived, no one will ever know, but that is why it has extreme heat temperatures, and the name Nova, Zaloc was formed by colliding 4 planets together and picking up the remains and forming a larger, more deadly planet with them, Basically this is Death’s plain, Lithianthus is very much like earth, it has a variety of populations, it has rivers, oceans, forests and pretty much everything else that earth has, except they are still in medieval times on this planet, so the technology on this planet is pretty non-existent and then finally you have Opthallies, which is exactly the same as Lithianthus, except for the fact that there technology is so advanced, that it makes the human race look like they have no experience with technology whatsoever. The original planet was Seran an exact replica of earth, until December 15 3475, when the collision happened. Each planet was sent through a specialised wormhole to the location of Seran, at the exact same time, altogether coming from 5 different directions as not to collide early, as this alien race had decided to build their planet over Seran, that is what they did, so 16:44:37 December 15 3475, all 5 of the planets collided and merged together over Seran, crushing the planet to a core in a matter of seconds, however during the collision, a rogue piece of Seran, escaped the centre of the devastation and collided with the top of Lithianthus, melding and forming a bond with that section of the world, and it was from that moment forward, that it was no longer to be known as Seran, Planet of the Ambient, but as Opthalianthus, Collision of the 5. Also due to its irregular shape, no one is quite sure as to how the planet is even stable enough not to tear itself apart, but there are a lot of specific details about this planet left unexplained, as to remain a mystery, which is the elusive fact of this planet as a whole. </p1>

<h2> An in-depth explanation of the 5 planets! </h2>

<h3> Nova: Fire </h3>
<p1> Nova is basically hell on a planet, if you may, its surface is covered with scorched plains, charred corpses, rivers of molten lava, slowly burning the banks away as it carries on, Volcanic ruptures violent enough to tear the earth apart. The sky is pitch black with no trace of stars, blood red clouds and red lightning splits the sky open on a regular but random interval of time, providing the planet with sparks of blood throughout the land. Other than that the planet cannot really be described as anything other than Hell. </p1>

<h3> Eregeten: Ice </h3>
<p1> This planet, is basically a freezer, temperatures here gauge at roughly -80oc but can reach up to -156oc. The sky here is always a light blue, never clouds because who needs clouds when the cold can destroy the heat. Every lake or river here has completely frozen over in a layer of ice so thick that nothing can get through it. The land is entirely snowed over with ice spikes and pillars protruding from the ground reaching anywhere from a few feet tall to a height of over 120ft. If that does not feel like enough, the rain is much better. Instead of simply raining rain, it rains ice shards that move fast enough and are strong enough to pierce concrete, and on top of that you get regular tornadoes that catapult these ice shards of death in every direction at 200 mph. </p1>

<h3> Zaloc: Darkness </h3>
<p1> The land of eternal darkness or as it has come to be known, Deaths Plain. This land is so tainted by darkness and death that it too has become a land of death, there is no plant life on this planet, no animals, just rotting carcasses and dead trees. This planet rarely has any type of weather anomaly; there is no water that is suitable to drink as all the water there has been turned a blackish red, tainted from death and blood. The sky is eternally black, with no clouds to speak of, and there is a very minimal amount of light, even the lamps to light the way around the planet have been tainted and dimmed, and just when you think that is enough, that it couldn’t get any worse, well it rains acid, due to the extremely high amount of pollution in the air, the only rain it has it a lethal amount of acid, hence the name Deaths Plains. </p1>

<h3> Lithianthus: Medieval </h3>
<p1> Lithianthus, the land of luscious green-lands, sprouting jungles, flowing rivers and waterfalls, a peaceful land, but not quite, for the fact that it is set back in the ages of medieval warfare. The atmosphere is always clear and it is always light, except for the fact that it rains without there being clouds, for some ungodly reason, as this indescribable action happens most days, fierce battles are waged over these lands, but the blood is washed away when the rainfall starts. Despite the extraordinary amount of rain this planet has, there are never any floods or highly damaging weather anomalies, strangely, although much more dangerous things wander here than you could imagine. </p1>

<h3> Opthallies: Futuristic </h3>
<p1> Now, Opthallies, the central for all things technologically advanced beyond human comprehension. This land has a fair amount of grass-land, but most of this land is towns and with their central city towering over everyone else in every aspect possible, technology exceeding anything everyone else has by over 50 times. Their entire city is disaster proof; with earthquake proof stability junctions under very building and road, lightning rods to collect, harness and use for power, reflector walls and barriers to stop tornadoes from passing through the walls, force-fields to stop ash from volcanic eruptions, the ability to propel itself up off the ground to about 150ft to avoid tsunamis, the city is practically untouchable. And above all else, in case you have not guessed already the city is dominated by an alien life force, far superior to humankind, as such is why their city is so impenetrable. </p1>

<h3> An explanation of the Time Sequences: </h3>
<p1> Okay, as it stands the planet is divided into three different time sequences, being Medieval, Present, and Futuristic, which would explain an aspect of why the world is so messed up, in a way. There is one planet that is set into the medieval plane of existence; there are three planets which are set in the Present, and one planet which is set in the future. Lithianthus only uses medieval grade weapons, Opthallies uses futuristic grade weapons, and Nova, Zaloc and Eregeten use a combination of both. </p1>
