      <h2> Types of Combat </h2>
      <h3> Melee Combat </h3>
      <p1> Melee is the form of fighting, that takes a more up close and personal approach, involving the use of blunt or sharp objects, and requires you to strike your opponent, rather than shoot them. There is a wide variety of melee weapons, ranging from heavy sticks, up to high-tech swords, all are usable by friend and foe alike. However, be careful, as objects have durability in this game, so be sure to keep your melee weapon in good condition for it to remain at maximum effectiveness. </p1>

      <h3> Ranged Combat </h3>
      <p1> Ranged Combat is the act of using a projectile based weapon for direct combat, or hidden combact, depending on what weapon you decide to use. Unlike melee weapons, projectile weaponry doesn't have a durability standard, However, they have a more complex system. Since these weapons dont use durability as a base of damage we decided to make it a bit more advanced, when it is raining in game, water can leak into your weapon, causing the gears to jam over time, therefore make the usability of the weapon, rather difficult. If your gun gets shot, it can cause damage to any given part of the frame, causing external damage and can even cause internal damage, also making the usability of your weapon go down, and you need to visit a weaponsmith to get them repaired. </p1>

      <h3> Explosive Combat </h3>
      <p1> Explosives are a quite a large accessory within this game, as they range from anything as small as a simple hand grenade, right up to a small antimatter bomb, which is capable of levelling building with a few micrograms. Anyway, these function quite different to other weapon types in the fact that they are thrown objects, therefore doubling as a close and long range weapon. Also making these different, they are the only weapon type able to be crafted. While being small, they are often quite deadly, and can result in harm being done to the user if not used properly. Explosive combat may not be too frequent within your game, but never forget to carry a couple, as they may come in handy. </p1>


      <h2> Additional Information on Gun Mechanics </h2>

      <h3> Ricocheting Bullets </h3>
      <p1> This Particular type of bullet, when fired, will bounce off of walls that it hits, until they strike an enemy or it has hit an approximate of 5 walls, before the bullet deteriates. This bullet can also contain any of the elements available in this game, However, these are the least potent variations therefore taking more bullets to kill an enemy. </p1>

      <h3> Laser Ammunition </h3>
      <p1> This type of ammo is useful for places with a large amount of walls, due to the superheated core of which these lasers are produced, they are capapble of penetrating multiple walls, leaving a burning ring from where it passed through. It is also great for multiple enemies, provided you can get the line for the shot done properly that is, although there are multiple versions of these lasers that you can get that will make certain jobs a bit easier. </p1>

      <h3> Firing Inside </h3>
      <p1> When you are firing inside, there will be situations where the bullet will be louder and some where it will be softer than usual, and this is because depending one the walls, will variate this. Say, for example, that you are in a wooden house, and you shoot, the gunshot will sound pretty normal, however when the walls are long and narrow, made out of concrete or steel, the bullet will be heard louder, and echo more than usual compared to if you fire in an enclosed space, you will get a loud ringing in your ears, due to the confinement of the shot, so bear in mind where you shoot from, it could save your life. </p1>

      <h3> Modifications </h3>
      <p1> There are a large amount of Modifications for your weapons in this game, and these range from silencers, foregrips, scopes, vacuum muzzles, and a whole lot more to choose from depending on what weapon you are using. Most weapons modifications will improve your weapon, but some will more than others, you cna have up to 6 modifications on each weapon as a default. however more slots are available to get via purchasing them or unlocking them at certain stages of the weapon's usage. </p1>

      <h3> Shooting Underwater </h3>
      <p1> This will be possible only with certain guns that have a waterproofed mod, as to prevent your weapon from jamming. Bear in mind that while shooting underwater, your bullets will move slower due to pressure, giving your enemy more time to move out of the way, making this combat a bit more tricky, however, the atmosphere of the water while fighting gives dynamic fight sequences you will not see anywhere else except for the depths. </p1>

      <h3> Energy Power Levels </h3>
      <p1> Energy weapons require power to function, therefore, the less power you have, the slower the weapon will fire and the less damage it will do. Recharging the energy is easy, as it recharges itself over time, but you can speed up the regeneration effect using modifications, or by using external power supplies which can be found anywhere near settlements. </p1>

      <h3> Bullet Types </h3>
      <p1> There are many different bullet types to be found throughout the world of Opthalianthus, these range from conventional to explosive, and on a rare chance you can find warped ammo, which is the strongest variant of any ammo type, and is deemed as unsafe to use. You can get elemental rounds, slug rounds, alien rounds, warped rounds and many, many more. </p1>

      <h3> Element Variations </h3>
      <p1> There are many different elements to be found within this game, such as Corrosive, Fire, Shock, Ice, Force, etc. These are just a few, a full list can be found below, aswell as a small description of what each one does </p1>
      
      <h4> Corrosive - Eats away metal, especially deadly on armored targets, also moderatley effective on flesh targets. </h4>
      <h4> Fire - Sets fire to objects it touches, incredibly dangerous on unarmoured targets, not so effective against armor. </h4>
      <h4> Ice - Slows down targets, preventing them from moving quickly for a few seconds. </h4>
      <h4> Shock - Causes an emp effect when used on technology, causes shields to deplete very quickly when used on a sheilded enemy. </h4>
      <h4> Force - Cracks the enemies shield if they are using one, preventing it from charging properly, while also sending the target back a few meters, causing unarmoured targets to break bones. </h4>
      <h4> Void - Surrounds the target in a layer of black fog, which eats away at their health like a plague for a few seconds, leaving the target weakened after the effect wears off. </h4>
      <h4> Holy - Especially deadly to undead and demonic enemies, causing the point of impact to flare up in a white flame, searing the flesh. </h4>
      <h4> Warped - Incredibly Deadly! Incredibly Unstable! These bullets are to be used with caution, while doing the most damage of bullets in the game, they can cause weapon errors also. </h4>
